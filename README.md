## General info

You'll find different directories in this repo, each of one is composed with the exercises done during the course mentioned above. They are intended to put in practice the concepts learned in the course. 

## Technologies

If you haven't done it yet, you'll need to download:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)

## Setup

To install all dependencies place you in the directories in which you can find a **package.json** file and run the following command:

```npm install```

## Usage

Most of the code you'll find in the *.js* files is commented by blocks

```
/* 
let i = 0;
let intervalo = setInterval(function () {
    console.log('Hola');
    if(i === 3) {
        clearInterval(intervalo);
    }
    i++;
}, 1000); 
*/
```
If you want to see how these individuals code blocks work, you'll need to comment them out. Do so by removing the `/*` at the beginning and the `*/` at the end of the code you want to check out.
